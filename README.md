In this repository youll can see all my work reated to AI models, based on extensive prior research using state-of-the-art techniques.ht the-state-art techniques

There are 2 AI models for dataset1. This are Binary and Multiclass classification models for different diseases: Stroke, Heart Attack and Diabetes. These models are explained and implemented in a colab notebook. 

There is also a CNN_model that is trained with Dataset 2, which is a collection of X-Ray models.

All the development of the presented models is  explained in my research paper "Research_EEB.pdf".
