# Research
In this repository you can see all my work related to AI models, based on extensive prior research using state-of-the-art techniques.

There are 2 AI models for dataset1. These are Binary and Multiclass classification models for different diseases: Stroke, Heart Attack and Diabetes. The models are explained and implemented in the given colab notebook. 

There is a CNN_model, trained with Dataset 2, a collection of X-Ray images, which classifies it into no diseases detected or yes, based on a probability.

There are severall methods for the evaluation of the models.

All is explained in my research paper "Research_EEB.pdf" including development, implementation and evaluation of the models givin several possibilities.
